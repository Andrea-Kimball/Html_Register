                <p>I was found in a car motor at a car lot. A lady who loves cats went and coaxed me out of the motor and took me to her house. I am very thankful that she took the time to get me out of there. I have a fantastic purr and a great personality. I will sit on your lap and chill with you once I get to know you. I was named Ryder because they found me in a car motor. I think my name is pretty cool!</p>

                <p>Rosie gets along well with other dogs, dogs of all sizes. She is submissive when she first meets them but quickly warms up and wants to play. When he doesn't want to play she will happily amuse herself in her yard by chasing squirrels, chipmunks, birds, rabbits, flies, snowflakes, leaves, anything that blows in the wind or runs in the grass.</p>

                <p>Hello, my name is Senorita and they estimate Im between 2-3 years old, orange/white, female cat available for adoption at Noblesville PetSmart. I came to Rescue Me RCHS from a Shelter with 4, 2 day old kittens(coming soon), and I was a great mom and took really good care of my babies! Im all ready to find a forever home of my own now though</p>

                <p>No one is really sure what breed I am. Maybe some lab, maybe some border collie, maybe some terrier, no one knows. I am about 3 years old and weigh 47lbs. I do great with kids of all ages and I'm also good with dogs and cats. I'm crate trained and housebroken.</p>

                <p>Just like his namesake, he is a quirky, fun little guy! Sheldon loves to run around with toys in his mouth, making chirping sounds as he plays! He gets along well with the other cats and kittens in his foster home. He has not been around dogs, but with proper introductions, he should do fine. It looks like Sheldon has two different colored eyes.</p>
